Agri-Connect is a web-based agricultural marketplace built to connect farmers and buyers in Kiruhura and Kazo Districts. The platform allows farmers to list produce (milk, matooke, and coffee), buyers to place orders, admins to update commodity prices, and all users to experience a more transparent and efficient agricultural value chain.

This project eliminates middlemen exploitation, reduces post-harvest losses, and supports direct farmer-to-buyer interactions.
